<p>I'm Curt Poff and this site is my personal blog. My <a href="https://curtpoff.com">homepage</a> and <a href="https://curtpoff.com/resume.html">resume</a> live over on the <code>curtpoff.com</code> domain. But it all leads back to me. Feel free to verify my ID at <a href="https://keybase.io/cpoff">Keybase</a>.</p>

<p>I have worked as a producer/project manager for the past 15 years, now with web developer added to my array of skills. <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?view=cm&fs=1&tf=1&to=curt.poff@gmail.com" target="_blank">E-mail me</a> if you know of any good gigs available.</p>

<p>I am married to the lovely <a href="http://gofitgirl.com">Go Fit Girl!</a>  We recently relocated to Tucson, previously from Portland and the Bay Area. I’m also a huge sports fan. My teams include the Kansas City Royals, Chiefs, Mizzou (football &amp; hoops), Newcastle United (long story), Portland State, Timbers, and Trail Blazers. It’s a lot, I know.</p>

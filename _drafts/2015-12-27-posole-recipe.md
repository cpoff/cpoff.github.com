Ann's mother - Sylvia - recently shared her recipe for the classic Mexican soup. We've made it twice now and we're getting really good. Here's what we know.

Sylvia told us to 'cheat' just a little, so our first pass called for only three ingredients: enchilada sauce, hominy, and pork shoulder. Ann chopped up the (half) pork shoulder. Made small pieces suitable for a soup. We dumped the pork and a large can of mild Las Palmas enchilada sauce into our Rival crockpot, then put it on high temp.

After a few hours we skimmed some of the grease off the top.

<p>I'm Curt Poff and this site is my personal blog. My <a href="https://curtpoff.com">homepage</a> and <a href="https://curtpoff.com/resume.html">resume</a> live over on the <code>curtpoff.com</code> domain. But it all leads back to me. Feel free to verify my ID at <a href="https://keybase.io/cpoff">Keybase</a>.</p>

<p>I have worked as a producer/project manager for the past 15 years, now with web developer added to my array of skills. <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?view=cm&fs=1&tf=1&to=curt.poff@gmail.com" target="_blank">E-mail me</a> if you know of any good gigs available.</p>

<p>I am married to the lovely <a href="http://gofitgirl.com">Go Fit Girl!</a>  We recently relocated to Portland from the Bay Area. I’m also a huge sports fan. My teams include the Kansas City Royals, Chiefs, Mizzou (football &amp; hoops), Newcastle United (long story), Portland State, Timbers, and Trail Blazers. It’s a lot, I know.</p>

        <p>Two weeks ago I shot my mouth off about how every single football team in my corner happened to win. Royals, Chiefs (went on the road to thump the Texans), Mizzou (looked horrible against an inferior opponent), Arizona, Portland State (knocked off Washington State for the school’s first ever win against a Pac-12 opponent).</p>

        <p>Now that I’ve spoken to several companies about web developer jobs, it’s clear the market is more competitive than I originally estimated. I’ve been dead-set against pursuing internships or volunteer opportunities in favor of a full-time (<em>paid</em>) role. I plan to maintain that strategy for as long as possible.</p>

        <p>I feel like I finally have a grip on Jekyll as it runs in GitHub Pages. It took several attempts to install the Jekyll engine (parser) inside the existing directory and setup, but it seems to be working. I had to delete the Pages directory a couple times and it looks like I lost some update counts. But whatevs.</p>

        <p>Summer is drawing to a close here in Portland, and I’m still looking for work. I had a good month of job search once my code class was done. But no solid offers came from it. So I’ll continue the search.</p>

        <p>I recently installed the Jekyll blog engine on my GitHub Pages site. All good so far but the configuration is going to take some time.</p>

        <p>Over the years, my wife and I got into the habit of eating most meals separately. The idea evolved from Ann’s dietary needs. She eats pretty healthy. I usually piece together what I can.</p>

        <p>We’ve been playing around with static site generators. Since I’m already using GitHub and Pages it seemed only logical that I use for testing. Jekyll is pretty straightforward so far. Let’s see how I can make this easier.</p>

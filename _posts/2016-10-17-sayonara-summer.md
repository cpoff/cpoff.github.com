Man, did we ever have a gorgeous summer. Last year was waaaay too hot. But this year was fantastic. Warm, sunny, lovely sunsets, the works.

But it's all over with. Pouring buckets last week, same for this week, more to come next week. Ann and I have a one-night getaway coming up on the Oregon Coast but I doubt we'll get to see much. Plan on cloudy and dark.

All else is good here. We're plugging along quite well. The Wife is keeping busy with her yoga and spin classes. She's a hard worker. I'm still plugging away under contract at Nike.

I'll try to update next month once I get back from my annual deer hunting trip to Missouri.

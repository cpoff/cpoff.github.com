This week finally saw the arrival of spring. It's been a hard winter and I'm so glad spring is here.

Seriously. We had a very cold, wet, dark winter. This week's forecast calls for four/five days of clear skies along with high daytime temps in the mid-70s.

I'm dying to mount up the motorcycle and get out on the road for a little ride time. Might even break out the shorts for a walk in the sun.

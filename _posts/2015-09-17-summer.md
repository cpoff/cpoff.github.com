Summer is drawing to a close here in Portland, and I'm still looking for work. I had a good month of job search once my code class was done. But no solid offers came from it. So I'll continue the search.

<!--more-->

Soon I'll likely expand the job search from just developer positions to include web producer and project manager gigs. I'm still determined to be a developer but I'm also sensitive to the fact that I need steady work. The sooner the better. I hope it all works out.

I’m Curt Poff. I’ve worked as a producer/project manager for the past 15 years, now with web developer added to my array of skills.

I’m married to the lovely [Go Fit Girl!](http://gofitgirl.com) We recently relocated to Tucson via Portland and the Bay Area. 

I’m a huge sports fan. My teams include the Kansas City Royals, Chiefs, Mizzou (football & hoops), Newcastle United (long story), Portland State, Timbers, and Trail Blazers. It’s a lot, I know.

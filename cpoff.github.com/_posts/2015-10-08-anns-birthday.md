My wife - Ann Chihak Poff - turns 41 on Friday. Check out [her blog](http://gofitgirl.com/) and I'm sure you'll agree that she may be the most lovely 41-year-old on the planet.

Later on this month she and I will celebrate our 12th anniversary. The best 12 years of my life. I can't imagine life without her.

We'll be celebrating with friends by having drinks/dinner at Montage, her favorite place of all time. Spicy Mac for m'lady.
